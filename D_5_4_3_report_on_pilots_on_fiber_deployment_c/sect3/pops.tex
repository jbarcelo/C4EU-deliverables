During this third year another four territorial PoPs have been raised and made operative, amounting to a total of 11 territorial and the concentration one (Telvent -Barcelona) being operational. \figurename~\ref{fig:pop_weathermap} shows their distribution on the map. So far all the territorial PoPs are connected to the concentration one via XOC connections\footnote{The prices can be found at \url{http://www.xarxaoberta.cat/en/prices}.}.

With respect to the IXs operation, the following improvements have been applied during this year:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Economic compenstion system put in place (see report \emph{D.7.3.2 report on building support for BuB4Europe - b}) and already put in practice in 3 PoPs.
  \item Netflow feature activated in all core routers (part of the information needed to put the Economic compensation system in practice).
  \item A second carrier of 1Gb/s has been added to the alreay existing one in Telvent.
  \item Load balancing infrastructure to ensure maximum efficiency of the uplinks and redundancy put in place.
  \item Upgrade of Telvent's infrastructure to 10Gb/s
  \item A third IPv4 block obtained from RIPE-NCC
\end{itemize}

\figurename~\ref{fig:telvent_diagram} shows Telvent's PoP at wiring level after being reorganised and upgraded to 10Gb/s techology.

During this period the number of peers at the CATNIX (the Catalan exchange point) has kept stable, but the traffic has steadely grown as \figurename~\ref{fig:catnix_transit} shows.

\figurename~\ref{fig:carriers_transit} shows the traffic of each carrier. As it can be observed he second carrier was activated in midMay. The effects of the load blancing can be observed from then on.

\figurename~\ref{fig:carriers_transit} shows the aggregated traffic of all guifi.net interconnections (the two carriers and the NIX) of the second week of November 2014. As it can be observed there are load peaks avobe 1.5Gb/s.

\subsubsection{Gurb}
\label{pop_gurb}

Operative since 2010, this year this PoP has been rebuilt to accommodate the hardware required for Gurb's OF pilot deployment and to install a new rack for servers. Firgure~\ref{fig:gurb_transit} shows the transit of this PoP in 2014.

\figurename~\ref{fig:others_transit} shows the transit in 2014 of the rest of the operational territorial PoPs that were already active in 2013. As it can be observed, traffic has significantly incremented in all of them.
