Work Package 7 of Commons for Europe project aims to support the creation of a pan European organization that could provide structure and support to the existing Bottom-up-Broadband initiatives in Europe from either public organizations or emergent from citizen activism. The present report accounts on the results of task T7.3, \emph{Building Support for BuB4Europe}, achieved during the its first year (second year of the project). 

T7.3 has a strong dependency on the outcome of T7.2, foreseen by the first half of the next year. As a consequence, the activity in T7.3 during this period has been limited at (informally) presenting the initiative to some local administrations and attending some international meeting.

Since T7.2 is being developed according to schedule and suffice resources have been allocated to T7.3 it is expected that this task  as well as WP7 objectives will be fully accomplished by the end of the Commons for Europe.
