\IEEEPARstart{D}{espite} the scepticism of some people about the capacity of community networks (CNs) to incorporate the optical fiber (OF) technology in guifi.net there are many on-going initiatives\footnote{In the guifi.net jargon these initiatives are referred as \emph{projects}} to do so. The fact that some of these projects are already in the stage of being fully operational, bringing of Gbs/s broadband Internet access to places (such as rural areas) where the traditional telcos are currently offering connections of few Mbs/s at most, proves that it is totally feasible to deploy and operate OF infrastructure according to the CNs principals following a bottom-up approach. Hence, the aforementioned scepticism is totally unfounded.

The present document reports the presence of OF in guifi.net, paying special attention to the three projects that have been selected as OF pilots~\cite{barcelo2012bub} in the Commons4Europe project and how they have progressed over the first year. The Gurb project has been selected as a pilot because it was the first OF project started and it is the most advanced one. The Vic pilot has been selected because it is a case of OF in an urban area. Finally Rub\'{i} has been selected as a case where the project at the moment is blocked.

Several new terms have appeared for this new way of deploying OF, such as \emph{Fiber From The Farm (FFTF/FFTx)}\footnote{A play on words (i) referring to the active-\emph{from} vs. passive-\emph{to} role of the end users of the CNs models vs. the traditional telcos models, and (ii) reaffirming the popular origin of the initiative \emph{farm} vs. \emph{home}. } or \emph{Bottom-up Broadband (BuB)}\footnote{Despite this term does not strictly refer to FO the reference is implicit since many people think that FO is the only way to grant the broadband.}, etc. all of them referring to the high degree of the implication of the end user in all the phases of the network deployment and operation.It is worth to mention that the BuB term was introduced in the Digital Agenda for Europe as the result of the guifi.net participation in the Stakeholder Day 2010\footnote{\url{http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/events/cf/dae1009/item-display.cfm}}. 

FO connections are all end-to-end (Point-To-Point) connections\footnote{Precisely speaking Passive Optical Network (PON) technologies allow Point-To-Multipoint connections. Despite they are widely used, also in guifi.net, for the sake of clarity in this document they are usually treated as a group of PTP links.}. Hence, the active parts concentrate in the edges. While the intercity connections usually form a mesh network, the so called \emph{backbone}, the intracity connections usually form starts, the so called \emph{user loop} or \emph{last mile links}, centred in the nodes of the intercity mesh. OF wires are passive, so all the electronics and logical configurations concentrate in the edges. While the next Section focuses on the physical part of the deployments, called \emph{deployments} itself, the following focuses on the nodes, named \emph{Points-Of-Presence (POPs)}. Section~\ref{sec:results} summarises the results achieved before Commons4EU was started, the results of the first year of the project, and the expected results for the next two years . Finally Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} sets the conclusions of the present document.
