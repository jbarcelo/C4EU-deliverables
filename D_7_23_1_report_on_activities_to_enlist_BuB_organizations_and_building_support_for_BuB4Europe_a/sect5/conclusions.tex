The results of the first year of fiber deployment are outstanding. Firstly, over 65 fiber connections have been made in 2012 (60 farms in the Gurb pilot), and 5 non-residential buildings in the Vic pilot). Secondly, 3 Points-Of-Presence (POPs) have been activated in 2012 and at least 4 expected for 2013, one of a selected pilots (Vic pilot). Thirdly, the activity is not restricted to the selected pilots since many other initiatives are going-on in parallel, some of them very autonomous and barely known by the guifi.net Foundation. Finally, the future is very promising since the model proves not only to be self-sustainable but to have an exponential growth.
