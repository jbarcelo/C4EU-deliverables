During the second reporting period four new operational PoPs have been added to the five already existing ones. Thus, there are already eight on-going deployments in paralÂ·lel and others are expected to consolidate during the next year.

As far as end-users accounting metric is concerned, in order to preserve the inherent autonomy of the BuB model and to better adapt to the current number of PoPs and its expected future evolution, in this report we introduced the PoPs traffic at the expenses of the precise number of end-users connected. By the end of this reporting period the aggregated OF transit (internet carrier + CATNIX peers) is above 500Mb/s (95\% percentile). The yearly traffic graphs presented show a clear sustained rising trend. 

In addition to the PoPs and end-user results, the contributions made in local economic promotion, social implication, digital divide reduction, etc. must also be highlighted.

Thus, the overall assessment of the job done and the results achieved so far is very positive. We face the last pilot year with the highest expectations.
