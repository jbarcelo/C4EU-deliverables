During this second year another four territorial PoPs have been raised and made operative, amounting to a total of eight territorial and the concentration one (Telvent -Barcelona) operational. Figure~\ref{fig:pop_weathermap} shows their distribution on the map. So far all the territorial PoPs are connected to the concentration one via XOC connections\footnote{The prices can be found at \url{http://www.xarxaoberta.cat/en/prices}.}.

With respect to the IXs operation, the following improvements have been applied during this year:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The management system has been notably enhanced.
  \item A new monitoring development was launched in June 2013 (consequently, most of the traffic graphs shown in the document stars at that moment).
  \item The implementation of a more efficient accounting system has been started and it is expected to be fully operational in 2014. This system will make the ISPs' theshowback/chargeback more accurate and fair.
  \item The equipment of most of the PoPs has been completed and updated.
\end{itemize}

As an example of the current state of the art of the PoPs Figure~\ref{fig:telvent_diagram} shows Telvent's PoP at wiring level.

During this period the CATNIX (the Catalan exchange point) peering process has been completed. As a result, the guifi.net Foundation is peering with all the other CATNIX members with the exception of the big ISPs (the Telefonica -the incumbent, Ono and BT). These ISPs have not shown any interest in peering with us.

Figure~\ref{fig:catnix_transit} shows the evolution of the peering traffic and Figure~\ref{fig:cogent_transit} shows the traffic to Cogent (our internet carrier). A second carrier is expected to be hired in the coming weeks, essentially to have a redundant internet access but also to anticipate the bandwidth demand.

\subsubsection{Gurb}
\label{pop_gurb}

This PoP has been operative since 2010. This year the power supply system has been improved by adding a back-up power supply. Also the electronic equipment has been significantly extended to accommodate the necessities deriving from Gurb's OF pilot deployment and other connections. Firgure~\ref{fig:gurb_transit} shows the transit of this PoP.

\subsubsection{Vic}
\label{pop_vic}

As already foreseen in the previous report, this PoP was activated few days after the report was realised. Despite the fact that Vic borders Gurb, This PoP was raised as an alternative to the impossibility of reaching the Gurb's PoP. The equipment is allocated in a data centre of a facilitate of the local government (http://www.vitvic.cat/). Firgure~\ref{fig:vic_transit} shows the transit of this PoP.

\subsubsection{Rub\'{i}}
\label{pop_rubi}

In contrast to Vic, where due to its proximity to Gurb the option of not raising a PoP was worked, Rub√≠ pilot clearly needs its own PoP. Thus, if the pilot is eventually developed in 2014 this PoP must be raised.
