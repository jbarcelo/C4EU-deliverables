During this second year another four territorial PoPs have be raised and made operative, amounting to a total of eight territorial and the concentration one (Telvent -Barcelona) operational. Figure~\ref{fig:pop_weathermap} shows their distribution on the map. So far all the territorial PoPs are connected to the concentration one via XOC connections\footnote{The prices can be found at \url{http://www.xarxaoberta.cat/en/prices}.}.

With regard the IXs operation, during this year the IX monitoring and management system has been improved\footnote{The new monitoring system was launched in June 2013. This explains why most of the traffic graphs of this only have data from then.} and a new accounting system meant to make more theshowback/chargeback of the ISPs efficient has started being developed (it is expected to be fully operational by 2014). New equipment has been acquired and put into operation in almost all PoPs. For example, Figure~\ref{fig:telvent_diagram} shows the current state, at wiring level, of Telvent's PoP.

During this period the CATNIX (the Catalan exchange point) peering process has been completed. As a result, the guifi.net Foundation is peering with all the other CATNIX members with the exception of the big ISPs (the Telefonica -the incumbent well known for its bad practices, Ono and BT). These ISPs have not shown any interest in peering with us.

Figure~\ref{fig:catnix_transit} shows the evolution of the peering traffic and Figure~\ref{fig:cogent_transit} shows the traffic to Cogent (our internet carrier). A second carrier is expected to be hired in the coming weeks, essentially to have a redundant internet access but also to anticipate the bandwidth demand.

\subsubsection{Gurb}
\label{pop_gurb}

This PoP has been operative since 2010. This year the power supply system has been improved by adding a back-up power supply. Also the electronic equipment has been significantly extended to accommodate the necessities deriving from Gurb's OF pilot deployment and other connections. Firgure~\ref{fig:gurb_transit} shows the transit of this PoP.

\subsubsection{Vic}
\label{pop_vic}

As already foreseen in the previous report, this PoP was activated few days after that report realise. Despite the fact that Vic borders Gurb, hhis PoP was raised as an alternative to the impossibility of reaching the Gurb's PoP. The equipment is allocated in a data centre of a facilitate of the local government (http://www.vitvic.cat/). Firgure~\ref{fig:vic_transit} shows the transit of this PoP.

\subsubsection{Rub\'{i}}
\label{pop_rubi}

In contrast to Vic, where due to its proximity to Gurb the option of not raising a PoP was worked, Rub√≠ pilot clearly needs its own PoP. Thus, if the pilot is eventually developed in 2014 this PoP must be raised.
