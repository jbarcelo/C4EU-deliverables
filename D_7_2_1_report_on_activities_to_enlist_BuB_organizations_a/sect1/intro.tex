Although there are community networks (CNs) and Bottom-up Broadband (BuB) initiatives all around the world -some of them pretty active and successful- the fact is that the movement remains largely unknown to the general public and to the public administrations and the policy makers in particular. Moreover, although they have many aspects in common such as targets, principals, background, etc., the degree of interaction and collaboration among them is negligible in general. As a result, each of them must cope with the obstacles -most of which are common to the other initiatives- alone and only with its own resources.

Work Package 7 (WP7), planned for the second (the current reporting period) and the third years of the Commons for Europe project, is aimed at supporting the creation of a pan European organization that could provide structure and support to the existing BuB initiatives in Europe from either public organizations or emergent from citizen activism. Such organisation must help make the organisations work more efficiently (e.i. each of the three biggest CNs has develop its own software tools to manage the network) as well as more effective in terms of dissemination, lobbying and influencing the policy makers.
