The third year, the last of the CommonsforEurope project, is crucial for WP7. The plans are to formally constitute the organization by the first half of the year and to devote the second half to promote it and enlist new members. Taking into account the results already achieve, the resources still available should suffice to successfully accomplish the aforementioned objectives.

In order to formally constitute the organisation the its characterisation must be finished. Afterwards the statutes drafted and the board of directors must be elected. We are convinced that the working dynamics already set will let us to conduct these tasks, some of which will involve long discussions and difficult decision making processes.

As regards the nascent organisation dissemination and new partners enlistment we plan to keep working on the websites and the mailing list as well as presenting our work results at the following major events:

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemindent}{2em}
  \item 68th RIPE meeting, Warsaw (Poland), May 2014
  \item Wireless Battle Mesh v7, Leipzig (Germany), May 2014
  \item International Summit for Wireless Community Networks 2014, Trieste (Italy), October 2014 (tentative place and dates)
\end{itemize}

We expect the vast majority of the active BuB initiatives around the world will have been informed about the organisation and we expect to already have a great number of them on board by the end of the project, thus to have fully accomplished the tasks T7.2 and T7.3.
