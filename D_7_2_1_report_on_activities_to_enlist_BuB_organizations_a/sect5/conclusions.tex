Work Package 7 of Commons for Europe project aims to support the creation of a pan European organization that could provide structure and support to the existing Bottom-up-Broadband initiatives in Europe from either public organizations or emergent from citizen activism. The present report accounts on the results of task T7.2, \emph{Enlisting BuB organizations}, achieved during the its first year (second year of the project). 

During this period the efforts have been focused on creating the adequate tools to manage the information resulting of the project evolution and to handle the discussions and on learning about the existing BuB initiatives and make the initial contact with some of them. As a result two websites
%(one meant to create awareness and the other to assist in the process of the organisation creation)
and two mailing lists have been created and half a dozen of the BuB initiatives contacted have responded positively to our invitation and are actively contributing in the process of the organisation creation.

The results already achieve suggest that T7.2 as well as WP7 objectives will be fully accomplished by the end of the Commons for Europe.
