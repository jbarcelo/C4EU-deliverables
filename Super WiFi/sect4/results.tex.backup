Figure~\ref{fig:tvChannels} shows the power level in the collection. Note that the X-axis is labeled with UHF TV channel numbers, each one $8$~MHz wide containing a maximum of four standard resolution or two high definition TV channels.

One of the tasks of the proposed algorithm~\cite{sanabriaCodeUSRP} is to assign a state (free or occupied) to each channel based on its power readings (in this case, thirty two per UHF TV channel). This can be visualized by looking at the right-hand side Y-axis in Figure~\ref{fig:tvChannels}.

A study performed by Domingo~\emph{et al.}~\cite{domingo2012white}, documented a spectrum sweep with a spectrum analyzer aimed at finding TV White Spaces at the same location as the testings in this work. The presented approach matched nearly 70\% of their observations, revealing 29 TV White Spaces against the 35 observed with the spectrum analyzer. This lower number is possibly due to narrow-band transmissions detected by the USRP.
